# CrossyRoad

A unique adaptation of the Crossy Road video game. 

## Game Description:
The game implements a duck character that is attempting to cross as many streets as possible without getting run over by the fish on the road at the time. The duck can be moved from side to side using the sliding potentiometer on the game board. It can also be moved up and down using the buttons on the game board. The more streets you cross without running into the fish, the more points you collect.

## Goal of the Game:
Collect as many points as possible!
